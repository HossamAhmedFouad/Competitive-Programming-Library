### Contributing
The ongoing development of this project aims to offer a comprehensive guide for competitive programmers, ranging from beginners to the highest achievable level. The objective is to include additional code snippets for various algorithms. You have the opportunity to contribute to the project by:
* My templates for different algorithms will be added. You can contribute to codes by:
  - Rectifying bugs and typos in comments, adding or improving comments, enhancing naming conventions, or refining the code structure to make it more concise, readable, and efficient. This can be done by raising issues or submitting pull requests directly.
  - Proposing additional data structures or algorithms to be incorporated into the project. You can suggest these through issues.

* Regarding road map, I am constructing based on my coaching experience at my university and my personal practice. Your contributions to this branch are highly valued due to the following considerations:
  - From my perspective, the lower difficulty levels tend to overlap. Hence, assigning a difficulty level to a problem requires the expertise of an experienced coach or feedback from participants with the desired competitive programming experience.
  - Problem selection (especially topic-specific problems) should aim to cover a wide range of experience points, encompassing various techniques, tricks, implementation details, and so on. This approach may result in excluding easier problems that are not suitable for initial stages, but that is acceptable.
  - Editing plan description, style, content, topic resources, problems or any other thing related.
 
* You can contribute to this in any way you want (issues, pull requests or [contact me](https://codeforces.com/profile/Rokba) to discuss it.
