# Level 2
Duration: 28 rokba days.

Target: be able to solve CF-div2 ABC(D)

### Content
* Graph representation - DFS
* Shortest Path (0-1 BFS, Dijkstra) 
* Floyd-Warshall (All-pairs shortest paths) - Bellman

## Timeline
To use this plan:
 - For coaches: each point of the content takes a week (1 session for teaching + 1 session for upsolving the sheat)
 - For trainees: try to master each point in at most (3-5) days (learning + finishing the sheet)
